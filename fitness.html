        <h1>Fitness</h1>
        <p> I started getting more into fitness during when the 2020 quarantine started</p>
        <p> Becoming a full-time remote employee presented many blessings and challenges</p>
        <p> I love the flexibility of being home for work, but I started to gain weight!</p>
        <p> I started investing into my fitness journey by starting a real home gym and paying more attention to what I eat.</p>
        <p> So far it's been one of the best decisions of my life! I feel stronger and have more confidence in myself... highly recommended for everyone!</p>
