        <h1>Computers</h1>
        <p> I got my first computer in 1996</p>
        <p> I wasn't allowed to use it freely, but I spent a lot of time hovering around my brother and sister while they did their thing</p>
        <p> Eventually I became better at using it than them!</p>
        <p> Growing up I spent most of my time at a computer exploring the wonderful world wide web</p>
        <p> When it came time to thing of something called a "career", something in computers was the obvious choice</p>
        <p> So many years later and I'm still learning!</p>
