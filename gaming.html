        <h1>Gaming</h1>
        <p> I have been gaming since I was 5 years old. It has become one of the reasons that I got into tech in the first place</p>
        <p> Gaming has allowed me to explore new worlds created by others in a medium that is challenging and engaging</p>
        <p> I'm hoping one day, I'll be able to make some games of my own!</p>

        <h1>This was the first video game system I ever got!</h1>
